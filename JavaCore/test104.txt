privetthe heavens' embroidered cloths
Language:â€‚English
Available translation(s): FRE HUN
Had I the [heavens']1 embroidered cloths
Enwrought with golden and silver light
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Of night and light and the half-light,

I would spread the cloths under your feet:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams
					William Butler Yeats
There are only two ways to live yor life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
